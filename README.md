### Running the attached code

You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder).

**Important:** If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use **your backend URLs** or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).
